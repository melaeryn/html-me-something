				<h2>About the Rose</h2>
				<div class="center">
				<p>The rose, which is the state flower of at least four different states and the official flower of the District
				of Columbia, is typically not meant to be given to someone for who you don't particularly care for 
				(give them a Geranium instead). Most interpretations of flower language for the different varieties of roses
				tend to be positive towards the recipient, someone you love or care about. They have, however, been the symbol of more 
				than just love- war and politics have both used rose imagery and motifs. The floral meanings below are strictly 
				just things I've learned over the years (because I love flower language!). This is also not an exhaustive list.</p>

					 <div class="center">
					 <p>The most common color of rose, red roses mean exactly what you'd expect them to. 
					 Nothing says "I Love You" like red, as it stands for passion, true love, romance, and desire!
					 The darker the shade of red, the more deeply the emotions behind the color are felt, and deep red 
					 roses often signify that you're ready for a commitment.</p>

					 <div class="center">
					 <p>If you're looking for a flower not to give a lover, but to give a friend, yellow roses are the 
					 way to go. They often symbolize friendship and joy, but can also wish the recipient good luck or
					 welcome back. Their sunny dispositions are sure to bring happiness to whoever you decide to give 
					 thes happy little blooms to! On the flip side, if you're looking to end a romantic relationship 
					 with someone, yellow roses can also represent lukewarm feelings towards the recipient.</p>

					 <div class="center">
					 <p>Not to be confused with ivory roses (which have an entirely separate meaning), white roses
					 are a symbol of purity and youthfulness. Not only that, but they are also frequently used to 
					 represent everlasting love. They're often used in bridal bouquets for obvious reasons. When
					 paired with red roses, they represent unity.</p>

					 a giant bouquet of peach roses! They often represent modesty, sincerity, and gratitude, so
					 they make the perfect center for a thank-you floral arrangement.If you're looking for soemthing

					 <div class="center">
					 <p>If you're reading these and are having trouble choosing a color to gift someone (especially
					 a lady in your life), you should probably go for a pink rose! They have many different meanings.
					 Pink roses exude feminimity, elegance, and sweetness, but depending on the shade they can mean
					 so much more. Hot pink roses convey appreciation and recognition, while pastel pink is used 
					 to impart joy, happiness, and gentleness. </p>

					 <h2 id="orange">Orange</h2>
					 <div class="center">
					 <p>Have you been feeling tired? Need something to bring some energy to your life but nothing
					 seems to be working? Buy a bouquet of orange roses! Orange is an energetic color, and as such
					 orange roses often represent enthusiasm and energy. Their bold, zesty color can also be used to 
					 congratulate someone and show your pride in them. Coral or salmon roses can also be used.</p>

					<a name="blue"></a>
					 <h2 id="blue">Blue</h2>
					 <div class="center">
					 <p>Blue is not a color of rose that exists naturally, as most are produced using either a blue floral dye
					 or by dipping the stems of white roses into blue dye. Therefore, the flower often comes to represent
					 the impossible. They also are usually used to represent mystery, so gifting these impossibe flowers to 
					 someone is a good way to tell them that they're intriguing and one-of-a-kind.</p>

					 <h2 id="purple">Lavender</h2>
					 <div class="center">
					 <p>Lavender roses are simply magical, a unique and gorgeous bloom that are not so frequently seen. 
					 They're often said to mean enchantment and wonder, and are typically used to indicate love or enchantment
					 at first sight. They can also represent majesty and splendor due to the color purple's relationship with 
					 royalty. If you're looking for a way to confess your feelings for someone, lanvender is the way to do it.  </p>

					 <h2 id="green">Green</h2>
					 <div class="center">
					 <p>The color green is universally recognized as the color of nature, and as such the green rose represents 
					abundant growth, fertility, and life. A refreshing color, green roses can also give the recipient a sense 
					of balance and hope, and they are all-around cheerful flowers. Though green is oft associated with envy,
					green roses are rarely used for such purposes. Want to give a coworker encouragement? Green all the way.</p>

					 <h2>Black</h2>
					 <div class="center">
					 <p>As one might expect from a black flower, the black rose is most often seen at funerals and has become synonymous 
					with death and mourning. They can also represent hate or tragic love, but black roses also have other happier meanings 
					as well. Though death is usually seen in a negative light, it can also be seen as the start of something new- and the 
					black rose also takes this theme as a meaning- new beginnings.  </p>
